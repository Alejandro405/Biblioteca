The client sends the request through the browser to the Web server/Application Server.
The server passes the client request to the respective servlet.
Servlet processes the request generates the response and sends the response back to the server.
The server passes the generated response to the browser/client.
Now, letâ€™s consider we have a requirement to call a servlet from another servlet bypassing the information using request and response objects. We can achieve this in 2 ways, servlet provides

forward() method in RequestDispatcher(I).
sendRedirect() method in HttpServletResponse(I)
